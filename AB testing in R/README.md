# Task Description
You are a team of senior analysts working for the Analytics Department of a consumer lending company. 
The company receives loan applications from consumers, mostly in the range of $20,000-$35,000, and 
needs to decide whether to approve or reject each of them. The overall goal of the company is to minimize 
their losses from bad loans (loans that default, i.e., that are not paid back) and maximize their profit from good loans (loans that get paid back on time). 
The company has been facing challenges related to loan approval review effectiveness. Your companyâ€™s 
loan officers (who work in the Loan Review Department) have been producing high error rates. They have 
been approving many loans that later defaulted which cost the company a lot of money.
