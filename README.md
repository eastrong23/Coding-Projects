# Coding Projects

A collection of projects completed during my MSc in Business Analytics and personal learning.

## A/B Testing in R
- R, statistical testing, ggplot visualization  

Conducted an A/B test in R to compare the effectiveness of a new loan approval model against the existing one. Since the case did not specify a clear business priority, both recall and precision metrics were used for evaluation.  

## RAG for Financial Reports in Python
- Python, LangChain, multi-vector retrieval, HyDE, self-critic  

Built a retrieval-augmented generation system using ASUS annual reports (2020â€“2024) as the knowledge base. Implemented multi-vector retrieval (combining embeddings and summaries), HyDE generation, and a self-critic loop to improve answer quality. The project demonstrates practical applications of advanced RAG techniques for document-based question answering.
